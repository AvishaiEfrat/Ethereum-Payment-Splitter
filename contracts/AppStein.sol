// SYNOPSIS: This is basically a payment splitter. It receives a 100% worth of recipient and sends them the funds which have been deposited in the contract.
// I've done my best to circumvent any potential security flaws (especially since the GUI isn't really needed to interact with the contracts) but this might still need to be tested. 
// You should also check out this OpenZeppelin audited branch which holds similar logic (payments splitter): 
// https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/payment/PaymentSplitter.sol
